# Google One Tap Guide

Google One Tap is a streamlined authentication system allowing users to sign up or log in with a single click using their Google account. Nudge AI integrates this technology to simplify the customer journey on your Shopify store and help acquire High-value emails.

## How Google One Tap Works in Nudge AI

Google One Tap operates through two main pathways in Nudge AI:

### 1. Acquisition via Nudge Smart Pop-up
- When a user visits the store, the system detects their logged-in Google account.
- At the optimal moment, a Google One Tap popup appears, suggesting easy sign-up and marketing subscription.
- When the user clicks the account in the popup, registration and marketing subscription are completed instantly without filling out forms.
- Verified, high-value emails are accurately acquired through Google in this process.

### 2. Acquisition via Sign-up/Login Page
- When a user accesses the sign-up or login page, the optimized 'Continue with Google' interface is displayed.
- Clicking this button completes authentication instantly, and the sign-up process, including marketing consent, is automatically finished.
- This enhances conversion rates through a seamless user experience and acquires verified, high-value Google emails.

## Key Benefits

- **Easy Sign-up**: Complete registration and marketing subscription simultaneously with one click.
