# Email Marketing Platform Integration

Nudge AI seamlessly integrates with popular email marketing platforms to maximize the value of the High-value emails collected.

## How Integration Works

Nudge AI operates through the Shopify customer database:

1. Emails acquired by Nudge AI, along with marketing consent status, are automatically saved to the **Shopify customer database**.
2. Most major email marketing platforms (like Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Omnisend, etc.) offer functionality to **automatically synchronize** Shopify customer data.
3. Therefore, without needing a direct integration setup, if the connection between Shopify and your email marketing platform is configured, emails collected by Nudge AI can be immediately utilized on that platform.

## Supported Platforms (Examples)

It can be used with almost any email marketing platform that integrates with Shopify. Major examples include:

- Klaviyo
- Mailchimp
- Omnisend
- Shopify Email
- Campaign Monitor
- Constant Contact
- (Other Shopify-integrated apps)

## Verifying Setup and Utilization

1. **Check Shopify Integration**: Ensure the email marketing platform app you use is properly installed and connected to your Shopify store.
2. **Enable Auto-Sync**: Verify that the option to automatically synchronize Shopify customer data (including new customer info and marketing consent status) is enabled in your platform app settings.
3. **Segmentation (Optional)**: Customers acquired via Nudge AI are tagged with `Nudge AI`. You can leverage this tag to create specific segments in your email marketing platform for targeted campaigns.
4. **Welcome Sequence**: It's recommended to set up an automated welcome email sequence for new subscribers acquired through Nudge AI to drive initial engagement.

## Manual Export (If Needed)

If auto-sync is not supported or if you need data from a specific point in time:

1. Go to your Shopify admin panel > Customers section.
2. Click the 'Export' button to download customer data in CSV format.
3. Import this CSV file directly into your email marketing platform.

## Troubleshooting

- If emails are not syncing to your marketing platform, double-check the integration settings between Shopify and the platform, and ensure the auto-sync option is enabled.
- For platform-specific integration methods, refer to the help documentation of your email marketing platform or contact their support team.
