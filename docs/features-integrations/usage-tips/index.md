# Usage Tips

Here are some tips to maximize the effectiveness of Nudge AI features for email collection and effectively utilize the collected data.

## Leveraging Collected Data

- **Check Shopify Customer Tags**: Customers acquired through Nudge AI automatically get the `Nudge AI` tag in their Shopify customer profile. Use this tag to identify and analyze customer groups acquired via Nudge AI.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Create customer segments based on the `Nudge AI` tag to deliver tailored marketing messages or promotions to users who signed up via their Google account.

## Utilizing Email Marketing Platform Integration

- **Verify Auto-Sync Settings**: Ensure that the Shopify customer data synchronization setting is enabled in your email marketing platform (like Klaviyo, Mailchimp, etc.). This allows emails collected by Nudge AI to be automatically added to your marketing platform for immediate use.
- **Welcome Sequence**: Set up an automated welcome email sequence for new subscribers acquired through Nudge AI to drive initial engagement.

## Performance Analysis and Understanding

- **Utilize Nudge AI Dashboard**: Regularly monitor Nudge AI's performance by checking the email acquisition counts and trend metrics provided in the app dashboard.
- **Understand the Value of High-value Emails**: Recognize and leverage the fact that emails verified through Google accounts have a lower likelihood of typos or inactivity, contributing to higher reach and efficiency in marketing campaigns.

## Other Considerations

- **Maintain User Experience**: While Nudge AI is designed to be minimally disruptive, consider its interaction with other popups or apps for the overall store user experience. Too many interruptions can increase bounce rates.
- **Continuous Learning**: Nudge AI's smart popup logic continuously learns and improves based on data. Allow the system time to optimize after initial installation.
