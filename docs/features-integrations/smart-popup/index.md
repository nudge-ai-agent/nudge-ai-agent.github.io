# Nudge Smart Popup Guide

The Nudge AI Smart Popup is an intelligent feature that utilizes AI technology to display the Google One Tap authentication popup at the optimal moment during a visitor's shopping journey.

## How the Smart Popup Works

Nudge AI's system automatically determines the optimal popup display timing in the following ways:

- **User Behavior Analysis:** Real-time analysis of various behavioral data such as page dwell time, scroll depth, click patterns, and mouse movements.
- **Customized Timing Optimization:** Displays the popup at specific moments judged to have a high likelihood of high-value email subscription based on each user's behavior patterns (e.g., staying on a specific page for a certain duration, reaching a particular scroll depth, entering the cart page, etc.).
- **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The system continuously learns based on collected data to optimize the exposure timing logic.

## Key Benefits

- **Optimal Timing Exposure**: Minimizes disruption to user experience and increases conversion rates by displaying the popup at the most appropriate moment analyzed by AI.
- **Intelligent and Automated Operation**: Operates automatically without requiring separate settings, as AI finds the optimal timing, thus reducing operational burden.
- **High Email Acquisition Potential**: Captures moments of high subscription likelihood based on user engagement and interest.

## Important Notes

- **Automatic Optimization**: The display timing and logic of the Smart Popup are automatically optimized by AI; there are no settings for users to adjust directly.
- **Design**: The popup uses the Google One Tap interface, and design changes are restricted according to Google policies.
