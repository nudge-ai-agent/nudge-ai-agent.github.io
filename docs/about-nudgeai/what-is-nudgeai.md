# What is NudgeAI & Its Value?

Are you facing these common challenges while running your Shopify store?

*   **Difficulty in obtaining customer names:** You want to know your customers' real names for personalized marketing, but mostly end up collecting only email addresses.
*   **Fake or incorrect email addresses:** The email addresses you worked hard to collect are often unused or have typos, reducing marketing efficiency.
*   **Low email subscription rates:** Many visitors leave your store without engaging, or abandon email subscriptions due to complicated sign-up processes.
*   **Inconvenient sign-up/subscription experience:** Customers hesitate to use your store because of the hassle of manually entering their email and information.

NudgeAI solves these problems and delivers the following core values to your Shopify store.

## Core Values Offered by NudgeAI

1.  **Revolutionary Growth of High-Quality Email Lists**
    NudgeAI utilizes Google One Tap technology to help customers subscribe to your store's email newsletter or complete membership sign-ups with just a single click. This enables rapid growth of high-quality email lists at a much higher conversion rate than traditional methods.

2.  **Acquisition of 100% Verified Gmail Addresses**

    Beyond just collecting email addresses, NudgeAI automatically gathers customers' real names (both first and last) registered with their Google accounts. This allows you to send more intimate and personalized messages like "Dear [Customer Name]," maximizing the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and increasing customer loyalty.

4.  **Clear Acquisition of Marketing Information Consent**
    NudgeAI is designed to clearly obtain customer consent for receiving marketing information during the Google One Tap information provision process. This plays a crucial role in reducing spam-related issues and building trust with customers.
