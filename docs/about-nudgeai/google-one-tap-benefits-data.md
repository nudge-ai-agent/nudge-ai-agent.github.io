# Google One Tap: Convenience for Customers, Value for Your Store

NudgeAI prioritizes customer experience, effectively utilizing Google One Tap technology across various service touchpoints (e.g., AI Plus Pop-up, AI Lite Pop-up, and login/sign-up pages when using Shopify's 'classic (Legacy)' customer accounts).

Let's explore in detail the convenience customers experience and the core values Shopify stores gain when customers use NudgeAI's Google One Tap feature.

## 1. Unparalleled Convenience Experienced by Customers

Regardless of which NudgeAI Google One Tap interface customers encounter, they will experience consistent convenience:

*   **Effortless Interaction:** Customers can complete all necessary processes with a single click (or tap) without needing to manually enter any information such as email addresses, names, or passwords. This minimizes customer effort.
*   **Significant Time Savings:** The time previously spent on information input is eliminated, allowing customers to focus more quickly on browsing your store's engaging content or products.
*   **Zero Typos and Password Management Hassle:** Since customer's Google account information is used directly, there's no possibility of typos, and customers are freed from the burden of creating and remembering different passwords for new sites.
*   **Familiar and Secure Experience:** It uses Google's authentication method, which is highly familiar to most customers. Therefore, through any of NudgeAI's features, customers can provide their information with confidence and peace of mind, trusting that their data will be handled securely.

## 2. Core High-Value Data Acquired by Your Store

Whichever UI NudgeAI uses to provide the Google One Tap feature (pop-ups, login pages, etc.), it accurately collects the following essential and high-value information with the customer's explicit consent:

*   **100% Verified Email Address:**
    Acquires the customer's **actual Gmail address currently in use** from their Google account, maximizing the reach and open rates of email marketing campaigns and minimizing bounce rates.
*   **Customer's Real Name:**
    Automatically retrieves both the **first and last names** registered to the customer's Google account. This enables more sophisticated and personal communication, strengthening customer relationships.
*   **Explicit Email Subscription Opt-in:**
    During the information provision process via Google One Tap (depending on NudgeAI app's "Marketing Consent Settings" or the design of each UI element), you can clearly obtain the customer's **consent to subscribe to the store's marketing emails.** This not only ensures compliance but also builds trust by ensuring customers receive only the information they desire.

**In conclusion, NudgeAI's Google One Tap integration aims to provide customers with an optimal, seamless experience and your store with the most valuable customer information (valid email, real name, marketing subscription consent).** This is a core value that runs through the entire NudgeAI service and directly contributes to building successful customer relationships and achieving marketing success for Shopify stores.
