## 2. Email Support (If Chatbot Resolution is Difficult or for Additional Materials)

*   If your issue cannot be resolved through the chatbot consultation, or if you need to attach additional materials like screenshots or files for a detailed inquiry, you can also contact the NudgeAI Customer Support team via our official **email address**.
*   **NudgeAI Official Support Email:** `support@nudgeaiapp.com` (Example)
