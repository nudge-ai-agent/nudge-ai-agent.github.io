# Troubleshooting Common Errors & Solutions

NudgeAI strives to provide a stable service, and it's rare for users to experience critical error messages. However, unexpected situations or configuration issues can occasionally prevent certain features from working smoothly or cause notification messages to appear.

Here are some possible scenarios, general solutions, and tips for handling errors.

## 1. NudgeAI Pop-up Not Displaying at All

*   **Situation:** The AI Pop-up (either AI Plus Pop-up or AI Lite Pop-up) is not appearing anywhere on the store (feature not working, without a specific error message).
*   **Solution:** Please follow the self-check steps outlined in our "[Troubleshooting Initial Pop-up Display Issues](../setup-guide/troubleshooting-initial-display.md)" document. (This includes checking Quick Settings in the NudgeAI app, subscription plan status, understanding pop-up display rules, browser cache/cookie issues, theme change history, and potential conflicts with other apps.)

## 2. "App Embed Not Enabled" or Similar Notifications

*   **Situation:** A message like "NudgeAI's app embed is not enabled" may appear on the NudgeAI app dashboard or in Shopify admin notifications.
*   **Cause:** The Shopify theme editor's 'App embed' setting, which is necessary for NudgeAI's UI elements (like pop-ups) to display on the store, is turned off or was not saved correctly.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Go to Shopify Admin Panel > Online Store > Themes.
    2.  Click 'Customize' for your current live theme.
    3.  Click the 'App embeds' icon (usually at the bottom of the left menu in the theme editor).
    4.  Find 'NudgeAI Email' (or a similar NudgeAI-related name) in the list and toggle the switch ON to activate it.
    5.  Crucially, click the 'Save' button (usually in the upper right of the theme editor) to apply the changes.
    *   For detailed instructions, please refer to the "[Step-by-Step App Embed Guide](../setup-guide/app-embed-guide.md)".

## 3. "Subscription Issue" or Billing-Related Notifications

*   **Situation:** You might see a notification related to a subscription or payment issue for the NudgeAI app.
*   **Cause:** This could be due to the free trial period ending without a successful conversion to a paid plan, or an issue with the payment method registered in Shopify, leading to a failed app fee payment.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  Check your current subscription status in the NudgeAI app admin page under the 'Billing' or 'Plan' menu.
    2.  Go to your Shopify admin panel's 'Settings' > 'Billing' section to verify that your registered payment method is valid and that there are no outstanding payments. Update your payment information if necessary.
    3.  If the problem persists, please contact Shopify Support or the NudgeAI Customer Support team for assistance. (See also "[Managing Your Billing & Invoices](../pricing/billing-invoices.md)")

## 4. Google One Tap Related Errors (Rare Cases)

*   **Situation:** A customer encounters an error or an unexpected message during the Google authentication process after clicking a 'Continue with Google' button or a NudgeAI pop-up.
*   **Cause:** This is very rare and can be due to various reasons, such as a temporary issue with Google's services, the customer's browser settings (e.g., overly strict third-party cookie blocking), or an integration issue between Shopify and Google.
*   **Solution:**
    *   First, you can advise the customer to try using a different browser or to attempt the action again in Incognito Mode.
    *   Clearing the browser's cookies and cache might also help.
    *   If the issue is not isolated to a single customer and consistently affects multiple users, please provide the specific error message or a detailed description of the situation to NudgeAI Customer Support for help in diagnosing and resolving the cause.

## When Error Messages Occur or Problems Are Hard to Solve:

*   **Record Error Messages:** If a message with a specific error code appears, taking a screenshot or accurately recording the entire message will be very helpful for troubleshooting.
*   **Describe the Situation in Detail:** It's important to understand on which page, during which action, and what specific problem occurred.
*   **Contact Customer Support:** If the above methods do not resolve the issue or if you encounter an unidentifiable problem, do not hesitate to **contact NudgeAI Customer Support**. ([Customer Support Channels Guide](./contacting-support.md)) Providing any recorded error messages, screenshots, and a description of the situation will enable us to offer faster and more accurate assistance.

NudgeAI is always working to provide a stable service and will do its best to respond promptly to any issues to minimize your inconvenience.
