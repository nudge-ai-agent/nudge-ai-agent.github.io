## Use of Google One Tap Sign-In
We offer a login option through Google One Tap Sign-In (or Google OAuth). By choosing this method, you grant us access to certain information from your Google account, such as email address, name, and profile image, according to the permissions you allow (e.g., basic profile data). We use this information solely to simplify the registration or login process, provide requested services, and enhance the overall user experience.

If at any time you do not want our application to access your Google account, you can revoke this permission in your Google account settings (found under "Security" > "Third-party apps with account access"). Once the permission is revoked, we will no longer be able to collect additional information from your Google account.

We do not use information collected through Google One Tap Sign-In for targeted advertising or marketing purposes without your explicit consent. All data obtained through Google OAuth receives the same level of protection and privacy handling principles as stated in this policy.

We may occasionally use the email address or other contact information of Shopify e-commerce businesses using NudgeAI services to send marketing or promotional communications about our services, new features, or special offers. This is only done in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, and we provide clear methods to opt-out of receiving such communications at any time.

When registering for our service, you are provided with an opportunity to opt-in to receive marketing communications through a clear checkbox or similar method.

## Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, accidental loss, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption of sensitive data, regular security assessments, access controls, and employee training on data protection practices.

While we strive to protect your personal information using commercially acceptable methods, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or as required or permitted by law for a longer retention period. For users registered through our services, we typically retain account information during the period of your active relationship with us, and for an additional 12 months after account closure or last activity. For email subscription data, we retain this information while the subscription is active, and for 6 months after unsubscription for anti-spam law compliance and analytical purposes.

You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us as described in the "Information Modification or Deletion" section.

## International Data Transfers
As our services are provided globally through the Shopify platform, your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your country of residence. By using our services, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to AWS data centers located outside your country of residence, which may include countries with different data protection rules than your country.
