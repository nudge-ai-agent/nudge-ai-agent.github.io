# Essential Requirements for NudgeAI Installation

To ensure a successful NudgeAI installation and seamless use of all its features, please first verify that your Shopify store meets the following essential conditions.

1.  **Have an Active Shopify Store:**
    *   NudgeAI is developed exclusively for the Shopify platform. Therefore, an **active, operational Shopify store** is mandatory.

2.  **Store Admin Access Rights:**
    *   To install the NudgeAI app from the Shopify App Store and to modify related settings, you must have **administrator (Admin) access rights** to the respective Shopify store.

3.  **Shopify Customer Accounts Feature Enabled:**
    *   NudgeAI is closely integrated with the customer sign-up and login processes. Thus, the **Customer accounts feature must be enabled** in your Shopify store settings.
    *   **Navigation:** Shopify Admin > Settings > Customer accounts.
    *   On this page, please verify that a "Customer account style" (e.g., Classic accounts or New customer accounts) is selected and that login links, etc., are activated.
