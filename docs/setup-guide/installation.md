    *   Alternatively, you might click on **'App and sales channel settings'** and then the **'Shopify App Store'** button. (Button names or locations may vary slightly depending on your Shopify admin interface version.)

4.  **Search for NudgeAI:**
    *   Once the Shopify App Store opens, use the search bar at the top of the page to search for **"NudgeAI"** or **"NudgeAI - Email"**.

5.  **Select the NudgeAI App:**
    *   From the search results list, find and click on the NudgeAI app. Please verify you've selected the correct app by checking the NudgeAI logo and app description.

7.  **Review Permissions and Approve Installation:**
    *   Shopify will display a list of permissions NudgeAI requires to access your store information. These are the minimum permissions necessary for NudgeAI to function correctly and provide its promised features. After reviewing the permissions, click the **'Install app'** button at the bottom or top of the page to finalize the installation approval.
    *   (For a detailed explanation of the permissions NudgeAI requests, please refer to the [App Permissions Explained](./app-permissions.md) page.)
