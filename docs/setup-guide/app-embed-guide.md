# Detailed App Embed Guide: Key to Activating NudgeAI Features

For NudgeAI's powerful pop-up features (like AI Plus Pop-up and AI Lite Pop-up) to display correctly and function smoothly on your Shopify store, it's crucial to activate the NudgeAI App Embed in your Shopify theme settings. This guide provides a detailed step-by-step explanation of what App Embed is and how to configure it for NudgeAI.

## What is App Embed?

Shopify's App Embed feature is a standard method provided by Shopify that allows app developers to securely and efficiently add app UI elements or scripts to specific parts of a store (usually applied theme-wide) without directly modifying the store's theme code.

NudgeAI uses this App Embed feature to integrate seamlessly with your store's theme and provide an optimal pop-up experience for your customers. Activating the App Embed allows NudgeAI to insert necessary code (e.g., pop-up display logic) into your store pages.

## Steps to Activate NudgeAI App Embed

You will be prompted to activate App Embed after installing the NudgeAI app or during the [initial setup steps](./initial-setup.md). Please follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Start from the NudgeAI App Dashboard:**
    *   Log in to your Shopify admin panel, navigate to 'Apps', and open the NudgeAI app.
    *   In the NudgeAI app dashboard, click the **"Enable app embed"** button found in the "Quick Settings" section or a separate guided area.

2.  **Navigate to Shopify Theme Editor:**
    *   Clicking the button above will automatically redirect you to the theme editor screen for your currently active Shopify store theme. The theme editor's left sidebar menu will be displayed.

3.  **Locate the 'App embeds' Section:**
    *   In the theme editor's left sidebar, find and click on the section labeled **'App embeds'** (often next to a globe icon). This section manages the list of installed apps that use the App Embed feature.

4.  **Activate NudgeAI App Embed:**
    *   Once the 'App embeds' section opens, find the **"NudgeAI Email"** (or a similar name like "NudgeAI") item in the list of installed apps.
    *   Click the **toggle switch** to the right of the NudgeAI item to turn it **ON** (it should change to blue or an activated state).

5.  **Save Changes:**
    *   After turning on the NudgeAI app embed switch, **this is very important:** you must click the **'Save'** button in the **top right corner** of the theme editor screen to apply the changes. If you don't click this save button, the App Embed activation will not be completed.

## Verifying App Embed Activation

If the App Embed has been correctly activated and saved, the App Embed-related notice in the NudgeAI app dashboard might change to "Activated" or show a green checkmark (this can vary depending on the app interface).

The most reliable way to confirm is to [visit your actual store and check if NudgeAI pop-ups are displaying correctly.](./verifying-setup.md)

## Notes for Specific Themes & Troubleshooting

*   **Theme Structure:** Most modern Shopify themes, especially those from the Shopify Theme Store, support the 'App embeds' feature as standard. However, with very old themes or themes that have been heavily customized in a non-standard way, the location of the 'App embeds' section might differ slightly, or unexpected issues could arise. For more details, please check the [App Embed: Notes for Specific Themes](./app-embed-theme-notes.md) page.
*   **Cache Issues:** Immediately after changing App Embed settings, it might seem like the changes are not reflected on your store due to browser caching. It's advisable to wait a few minutes, or try checking your store in your browser's incognito/private mode, or after clearing your browser cache.
*   **If Problems Occur:** If you've followed all the steps above but are still having trouble activating App Embed or NudgeAI features are not working as expected, please do not hesitate to [contact NudgeAI Customer Support](../support/contacting-support.md). Providing your store information and a specific description of the problem will help us assist you promptly.

Activating the App Embed is an essential step to ensure all NudgeAI features work smoothly. Follow this guide carefully to set it up correctly and experience the full benefits of NudgeAI!
