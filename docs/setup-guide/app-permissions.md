# Understanding NudgeAI App Permissions & Their Necessity

When you install the NudgeAI app in your Shopify store, Shopify will display a screen requesting several permissions necessary for our app to function correctly and deliver its promised value to your store. All requested permissions are essential for implementing NudgeAI's core features and providing you with the best possible service.

NudgeAI takes your valuable information very seriously. We promise that all collected information will be managed securely and used in compliance with all Shopify policies and relevant regulations.

## Key Permissions Requested by NudgeAI and Why They Are Needed

The following are the main permission requests displayed by Shopify during NudgeAI app installation and the reasons why each permission is necessary. (The actual permission request screen may vary slightly depending on the Shopify interface.)

1.  **View personal data**
    *   **Details (Example):** Customer information (name, email address, phone number, physical address, etc.), Store owner information (name, email address, etc.)
    *   **Why it's needed:**
        *   **Access to Customer Information:** NudgeAI's core function is to collect customers' real names and email addresses via Google One Tap. This permission is necessary to accurately record the collected customer information in your Shopify customer database, register them as new customers, or update existing customer information. (While NudgeAI does not currently collect/use phone numbers or physical addresses directly, this permission covers standard fields that may be part of Shopify's customer data structure.)
        *   **Access to Store Owner Information:** This may be needed during the initial app setup process or for customer support to verify basic information required for store operation, or to deliver important app-related announcements.

2.  **View and edit store data**
    *   **Details (Example):** Edit customers (Customer data)
    *   **Why it's needed:** This permission is required to create new entries or update existing information in your Shopify customer data with details such as names, email addresses, and marketing consent status collected via Google One Tap. For example, if a customer subscribes to a newsletter through a NudgeAI pop-up, this information is reflected in your Shopify customer list.
    *   *Note: You might see a Shopify permission description like "Customers shopping through NudgeAI - Email will be able to see tags added to their customer account." This could refer to NudgeAI's potential to use customer tags to offer different experiences to specific customer groups, or it might be a general description of Shopify's storefront permissions. NudgeAI can generate or utilize useful customer tags based on the collected information.*

3.  **View store analytics**
    *   **Details (Example):** Analytics
    *   **Why it's needed:** This is necessary to display key performance indicators in the NudgeAI app dashboard, such as how many high-quality emails and customer details have been collected, and the conversion rate of pop-up impressions, providing you with useful analytical insights.

4.  **View your Online Store**
    *   **Details (Example):** Theme
    *   **Why it's needed:** Access to theme-related information is required to ensure that NudgeAI's user interface (UI) elements, such as the AI Plus Pop-up and AI Lite Pop-up, are displayed correctly and function properly within your store's theme, and to securely integrate them via Shopify's App Embed feature if necessary.

5.  **View other data**
    *   **Details (Example):** Reports
    *   **Why it's needed:** Similar to store analytics data, this may be required to generate or reference internal data analysis reports for measuring the overall performance of the NudgeAI service and for feature improvements.
