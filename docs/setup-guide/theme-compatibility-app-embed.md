## NudgeAI and Shopify Theme Compatibility

1.  **High Compatibility with Standard Themes:**
    *   NudgeAI boasts high compatibility with official standard themes provided by Shopify, as well as popular modern themes.
    *   In most instances, you can use all of NudgeAI's features immediately without needing to modify your theme's code directly.

2.  **Custom Themes and Points to Note:**
    *   If your store uses a theme that has been **extensively customized** in a way that significantly deviates from Shopify's standard structure, involves substantial non-standard code modifications, or if you are using a very outdated theme version, there's a rare chance that certain NudgeAI UI elements (e.g., pop-ups) might not display or function as anticipated.
    *   The possibility of functional conflicts with other installed apps cannot be entirely dismissed. This is a general occurrence within the Shopify app ecosystem.
    *   **In Case of Issues:** If NudgeAI's pop-ups or features don't seem to be working as expected, please don't hesitate to contact the [NudgeAI Customer Support team](../../support/contacting-support.md). Providing the name of your theme and a specific description of the problem will greatly assist in resolving the issue.

## Integration via App Embed Feature

1.  **What is App Embed?**
    *   Shopify's App Embed feature is the official, recommended method for app developers to securely integrate an app's UI elements into a store's theme without directly altering the theme code.

2.  **NudgeAI and App Embed:**
    *   User interface elements of NudgeAI, such as the AI Plus Pop-up and AI Lite Pop-up, are displayed on your store theme through this App Embed functionality.
