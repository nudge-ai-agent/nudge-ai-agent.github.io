# App Embed: Notes for Specific Themes

NudgeAI is designed to be compatible with most modern themes by using Shopify's standard App Embed method. However, with certain specific themes or highly customized themes, there might be a few things to note when locating or applying App Embed settings.

## General Notes

*   **Check Theme Documentation:** The most accurate information on how your Shopify theme supports App Embed functionality for third-party apps can usually be found in the theme's official documentation or via its developer support channels. Some themes might have slightly different naming or approaches for their App Embed section.

*   **Using Up-to-Date Themes is Recommended:** Whenever possible, it's advisable to use the latest version of themes available from the Shopify Theme Store. Modern themes generally offer full support for Shopify's latest features (including App Embeds) and tend to have better compatibility with other apps.

*   **Heavily Code-Modified Themes:** If your store theme's liquid code has been extensively modified directly, or if many changes have been made in a non-standard way, there's a possibility that the App Embed feature might not work as expected, or NudgeAI's UI elements might not display correctly. This could be due to the theme's structure deviating from the standard.

*   **Outdated or Discontinued Themes:** Very old versions of themes, or themes that are no longer supported by their developers, might not support the latest App Embed standards, potentially leading to issues.

## Troubleshooting Steps for Issues

If you encounter the following problems despite following the standard procedures outlined in the [Detailed App Embed Guide](./app-embed-guide.md):

*   You cannot find the 'App embeds' section in your theme editor.
*   NudgeAI features (e.g., pop-ups) do not appear on your store at all, even after activating and saving the NudgeAI App Embed.
*   NudgeAI UI appears broken or seems to conflict with certain theme elements.

Please first [contact NudgeAI Customer Support](../support/contacting-support.md). Providing the following information with your inquiry will greatly help in resolving the issue:

*   **The exact name and version of your Shopify theme** (This can usually be found in the Theme Editor or under Shopify Admin > Online Store > Themes).
*   **A specific description of the problem you are experiencing** (e.g., on which page the issue occurs, screenshots, etc.).

Our support team will promptly assess your situation, determine if it's a theme-related issue or due to another cause, and provide possible solutions or further guidance.
