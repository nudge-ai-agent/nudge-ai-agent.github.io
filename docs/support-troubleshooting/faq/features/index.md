## Nudge Smart Pop-up

**Q: Can I customize the Nudge Smart Pop-up message or design?**

A: Nudge AI utilizes the Google One Tap feature, and according to Google's policies, customizing the design of this interface is restricted. This also serves as an advantage by providing users with Google's consistent and highly trusted interface they are already familiar with.

**Q: Won't the popup interfere with the user experience?**

A: Nudge AI is designed with user experience as a top priority. The system, based on user behavior analysis, displays the Nudge Smart Pop-up only at the most opportune moments. It is implemented with a low-interference design and a user-friendly UI. Once a user closes the popup, it will not reappear for a certain period.

## Email Collection Effectiveness

**Q: How many more emails can I actually collect compared to a standard subscription form?**

A: Traditional subscription forms act as a 'barrier' requiring visitors to manually enter information. Annoyance, time consumption, potential typos, and privacy concerns can lead to drop-offs. Nudge AI virtually eliminates this barrier through Google One Tap. Everything is completed with a single click through a familiar and trusted process. By removing this key barrier, more visitors are likely to complete the subscription process itself. The degree of improvement varies by store, so check it out with the 14-day free trial.
