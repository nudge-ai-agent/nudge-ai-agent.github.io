# Installation FAQ

### Q: Does installing the app affect my site speed?

A: Nudge AI is optimized to minimize impact on site performance. It uses asynchronous loading and is designed to be lightweight, so it does not affect page loading times.

### Q: Can I customize the Nudge Smart Pop-up message or design?

A: Nudge AI utilizes the Google One Tap feature. Due to Google's policies, customizing the design of this interface is restricted. This also serves as an advantage, providing users with Google's consistent and highly trusted interface, which they are already familiar with.
