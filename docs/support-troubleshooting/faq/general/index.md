# General FAQ

### Q: Will the pop-up interfere with the user experience?

A: Nudge AI is designed with the user experience as a top priority. Our user behavior analysis system displays the Nudge Smart Pop-up only at the most opportune moments. It features a low-interference design and a user-friendly UI. If a user closes the pop-up, it will not reappear for a certain period.

### Q: How many more emails can I actually collect compared to a standard subscription form?

A: Traditional subscription forms act as a 'barrier' for visitors, requiring them to manually enter information. Factors like hassle, time consumption, potential typos, and privacy concerns lead to drop-offs. Nudge AI virtually eliminates this barrier through Google One Tap. With just a single click, everything is completed through a familiar and trusted process. By removing this key barrier, the likelihood of more visitors completing the subscription process itself increases significantly. The degree of improvement varies by store, so we recommend checking it out with our 14-day free trial.

### Q: What happens after the 14-day free trial ends?

A: You will receive a notification before your free trial period expires. If you do nothing, your chosen plan will automatically activate upon trial completion, and billing will commence. To avoid charges if you decide not to continue using the app, simply uninstall it before the trial period ends.

### Q: What should I do if I migrate my Shopify store or change my theme?

A: If you migrate your Shopify store to a different account, you will need to reinstall Nudge AI on the new store and start a new subscription; existing subscriptions do not transfer. If you only change your theme, you simply need to re-enable the 'App Embed' setting within the new theme (refer to the Setup Guide, section 5).
