# Double opt-in vs Single opt-in?
### A New Alternative for Shopify Merchants: NudgeAI

Email marketing still boasts one of the highest ROIs. However, **how you obtain customer consent** drastically divides the quality and profitability of your email list.

Most Shopify merchants grapple with two main choices:

- **Single opt-in**: Registration complete upon submission → Fast conversion speed, messy list.
- **Double opt-in**: Registration complete after clicking confirmation email → Clean list, significant drop in conversions.

So, is it possible to achieve both fast conversions and a high-quality list?
→ **This is where NudgeAI comes in.**

## The Value and Limitations of Double Opt-in

The Shopify Blog evaluates double opt-in as follows:

**Advantages**

- Filters out incorrect email addresses
- Reduces spam complaints/risks
- Meets legal requirements like GDPR

**Disadvantages**

- Lowers conversion rates (subscription fails if the confirmation email isn't opened)
- Cannot deliver immediate benefits
- Clunky UX, especially on mobile

---

## Single Opt-in is Fast but Risky

While you can acquire more subscribers:

- Increase in fake emails, incorrect addresses, and unintentional sign-ups.
- Eventually leads to higher email bounce rates → Decreased sender domain reputation.
- Performance on platforms like Klaviyo or Shopify Email also declines.

## Single Opt-in vs Double Opt-in: Concept Clarification

Shopify's official blog explains the difference between the two opt-in methods as follows:

### 🔹 Single Opt-in

- User is added to the email list immediately after submitting their email.
- Fast and simple, no extra confirmation step.
- However, prone to typos, fake emails, and unintentional sign-ups.

### 🔹 Double Opt-in

- A **confirmation email** is sent after the user submits their email.
- User must **click the confirmation link** in the email to complete registration.
- Ensures only accurate email addresses and genuinely interested subscribers are collected.

> **Shopify emphasizes that double opt-in is advantageous in the long run for improving email quality, reducing legal risks, and increasing subscriber engagement.**
