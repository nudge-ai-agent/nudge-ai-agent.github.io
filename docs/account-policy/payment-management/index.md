# Payment Management

Nudge AI payments are securely processed through Shopify's billing system.

*   **Billing Cycle:** We offer a monthly billing option through the Shopify App Store.
*   **Payment Method:** Charges are automatically processed using the payment method registered in your Shopify account.
*   **Invoices:** Invoices for all payments can be found in your Shopify billing history and are also automatically sent via email.
*   **Free Trial:** No charges occur during the 7-day free trial period. You will receive a notification before the trial ends.
*   **Automatic Renewal:** Unless canceled, your subscription automatically renews according to Shopify's official renewal cycle (typically 30 days), and charges will apply.

You can manage your subscription and view billing details directly within your Shopify admin panel under the billing section.
