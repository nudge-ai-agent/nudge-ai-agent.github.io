# Terms of Use
These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) govern the use of the website and any related services (collectively, the “Service”) provided by NDAi (hereinafter referred to as the “Operator,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). This Agreement constitutes a legally binding contract between the user (“User,” “you”) and the Operator. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may not access or use the Service.

This Agreement is executed in an electronic form and remains legally binding even without a physical signature. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement.



## 1. Account and Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years of age to register and use our Service. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you are 13 years of age or older. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activities that occur under it.

We may, at our discretion, monitor or review new accounts, but are under no obligation to do so. If you violate any provision of this Agreement or if your actions could potentially harm our reputation and goodwill, we reserve the right to suspend or delete your account at any time. If your account is terminated for such reasons, you may not re-register using the same or similar information. We may block your email address or IP address to prevent further registrations.

By creating an account or otherwise providing your contact information, you agree that we may send you marketing or promotional emails within the scope permitted by our Privacy Policy. You can unsubscribe from these marketing emails at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email or by contacting us at info@uneedcomms.com. Please note that we may still send you essential service-related notices (e.g., billing, security alerts) even if you opt out of marketing emails.



## 2. Watermark (Brand Exposure) Policy
We display a watermark (brand name) at the bottom of pages where our Service is implemented (e.g., websites, landing pages), in order to increase brand visibility and gain promotional benefits. This watermark policy applies to all users, and users cannot remove or hide the watermark under any circumstances.

Upgrading to a different plan or subscribing to a particular option does not exempt you from displaying the watermark. If you do not agree to this policy, you may be restricted from using our Service.

You shall not use the website and Service for the following purposes:

(a) Any unlawful purpose;
(b) Soliciting others to perform or participate in any unlawful acts;

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranties
We provide the website and Service on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis, without any express or implied warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the website or Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, fully secure, or that any defects will be corrected. We make no representations regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the content or information provided.

Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of specific warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.



## 5. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we and our employees, agents, partners, suppliers, and licensors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, loss of profits, revenue, or data) arising from your use of the website and Service or in connection with this Agreement.

In any event, our total liability shall not exceed one US dollar (USD 1) or the actual amount you paid to us in the most recent one-month period, whichever is greater. Certain jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so some parts of these limitations may not apply to you.



## 6. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Operator, its employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers from and against any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the website and Service, your willful misconduct, or any content you post or share through the Service.



## 7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted by the laws of the Republic of Korea, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising in connection with this Agreement or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Seoul, Republic of Korea. If the laws of your residence do not allow for the application of Korean law or for certain dispute resolution provisions, your statutory rights under those local laws may take precedence.

We reserve the right to amend or modify this Agreement at any time by posting an updated version on our website. Such changes become effective upon posting. When we update the Agreement, we will revise the “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of the website and Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Agreement.
