# Free Trial & Conversion to Paid Plan

NudgeAI offers a **7-day free trial period for all subscription plans (Starter, AI-Growth, AI-Scale)** so you can fully experience all features of the service and make an informed decision before committing to a paid subscription. During the free trial, you can use all the features of your chosen plan without any limitations.

## 1. Starting Your Free Trial

1.  **Install the NudgeAI App from the Shopify App Store:**
    *   Search for "NudgeAI" in the Shopify App Store and install the app.
2.  **Select a Subscription Plan:**
    *   During the initial setup process after installing the app, choose one of the NudgeAI subscription plans (Starter, AI-Growth, or AI-Scale). The 7-day free trial applies equally to all plans.
    *   If you're unsure which plan to choose, please refer to our "[Choosing the Right NudgeAI Plan for Your Store](choosing-your-plan.md)" document.
3.  **Approve Shopify Billing (to Start Free Trial):**
    *   Proceed through Shopify's standard billing approval process for the plan you selected. **You will not be charged at this step.** This initiates your 7-day free trial. Shopify requires this process to ensure a smooth transition to a paid subscription after the trial period ends.

## 2. During Your Free Trial Period

*   **Utilize All Features:** Explore all the functionalities of your chosen plan. Focus on experiencing the value NudgeAI provides by setting up AI Pop-ups (AI Plus, AI Lite), collecting customer information, checking Shopify customer list synchronization, and navigating the NudgeAI dashboard.
*   **Collect Real Data:** Apply NudgeAI to your store and see how many 'High-value' emails are actually collected.
*   **Get Support:** If you have any questions or encounter technical issues during use, don't hesitate to contact our customer support team via the in-app chatbot.

## 3. End of Free Trial & Automatic Conversion to Paid Plan

*   **Automatic Conversion:** Your NudgeAI subscription will **automatically convert to a paid subscription for the plan you selected when the 7-day free trial period ends** (starting the day after the trial expires).
*   **No Action Required (to Continue):** Unless you cancel your subscription or change to a different plan, the monthly fee for your chosen plan will be charged on your next Shopify billing date along with your Shopify store operating fees.
*   **Shopify Integrated Billing:** NudgeAI app fees are billed through Shopify's integrated billing system, so you don't need to provide separate payment information to NudgeAI; it's managed securely by Shopify. You can view your billing details in the 'Settings' > 'Billing' section of your Shopify admin panel.
*   **Uninterrupted Service:** Generally, the NudgeAI service will continue uninterrupted when transitioning from a free trial to a paid plan.

## 4. Changing Your Subscription Plan

You can change your NudgeAI subscription plan at any time, whether during the free trial or a paid subscription.

*   **How to Change Your Plan:**
    1.  Go to your Shopify admin panel > Open the NudgeAI app.
    2.  In the NudgeAI app dashboard (admin page), select the **'Billing'** or 'Plan' menu.
    3.  Choose the new plan you want and click the 'Change Plan' button.
    4.  Follow Shopify's prompts to confirm the plan change.
*   **Upgrading:** Upgrades are applied immediately, and you will be charged a prorated amount for the difference between your old and new plan for the remainder of the current billing cycle.
*   **Downgrading:** Downgrades are also applied immediately. Any price difference for the remainder of the current billing cycle for your old plan may be issued as an application credit according to Shopify's policies.

## 5. Cancelling Your Subscription (Uninstalling the App)

If you wish to discontinue using the NudgeAI service, you can cancel your subscription by uninstalling the app directly from your Shopify admin panel.

*   **How to Cancel Your Subscription:**
    1.  Go to your Shopify admin panel > 'Settings' > 'Apps and sales channels'.
    2.  Find the NudgeAI app, click the '...' (more options) button next to it, and then click 'Uninstall' or 'Remove'.
*   **Data After Cancellation:**
    *   **Very Important: Even if you cancel your subscription, all customer information collected through NudgeAI (names, emails, marketing consent status, tags, etc.) will remain safely in your Shopify customer database, and you will continue to have access to and be able to use it.** You own 100% of this data.
    *   Data already synced to external marketing platforms (like Klaviyo, Mailchimp) will also remain available on those platforms.
*   **Future Billing:** Uninstalling the app (cancelling the subscription) is processed immediately, and you will not be billed for the NudgeAI app from the next billing cycle.

NudgeAI is committed to ensuring you can use our service with confidence and that your valuable collected customer data is securely managed and continuously usable. If you have any further questions regarding the free trial, conversion to a paid plan, plan changes, cancellation, or data, please do not hesitate to contact our customer support team.
