# Billing & Invoices

All subscription-related account management, including NudgeAI app fees, is handled through your Shopify store's **centralized billing system**. This allows you to manage everything conveniently and securely in a way you are already familiar with. You do not need to enter separate payment information within the NudgeAI app or navigate complex account management pages.

## 1. Key Account Management Items & How to Access Them (within Shopify Admin)

### a. Changing Your Payment Method

*   NudgeAI app fees, like your Shopify store operating fees, are **automatically charged to your primary payment method registered with Shopify.**
*   If you wish to change your payment method (e.g., credit card information), you can do so in your Shopify admin panel:
    1.  Log in to your Shopify admin.
    2.  Click on **'Settings'** in the bottom left menu.
    3.  In the Settings menu, select **'Billing'**.
    4.  In the 'Payment methods' section, you can view your currently registered payment methods and modify them or add a new one as needed.
*   The payment method changed here will apply equally to your Shopify store operating fees and all Shopify app subscription fees, including NudgeAI.

### b. Viewing Invoices

*   Your monthly or annual Shopify invoices, which include NudgeAI app fees, can be found in the **'Billing'** section of your Shopify admin panel.
*   The 'Billing' page provides a detailed view of past charges. Each invoice clearly itemizes all app subscription fees, including NudgeAI, alongside your Shopify store operating fees for transparent management.
*   You can also download each invoice as a PDF file if needed.

## 2. Conclusion

NudgeAI's subscription billing and related account management are handled entirely through **Shopify's secure and integrated billing system.** This is to help you efficiently manage all your Shopify-related expenses in one place, without needing to manage payment information across multiple platforms.
