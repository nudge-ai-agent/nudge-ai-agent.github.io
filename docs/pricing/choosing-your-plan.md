# Choosing the Right NudgeAI Plan for Your Store

NudgeAI offers three main subscription plans (Starter, AI-Growth, AI-Scale) designed to provide optimal value based on your store's current size, monthly visitor traffic, and email marketing goals. All plans include NudgeAI's core features, and you can try any plan with a 7-day free trial to experience it firsthand before deciding.

If you're wondering which plan is best for your store, consider the following guidelines.

## 1. Key Factors to Consider

When choosing a plan, it's helpful to primarily consider these three factors:

*   **Monthly Store Visitors:** The more visitors your store has, the more opportunities you have to collect emails through NudgeAI.
    *   **How to Check Your Store's Monthly Visitors (Using Shopify Analytics):**
        *   You can directly check your Shopify store's monthly visitor count through the analytics feature in your Shopify admin panel. It's advisable to identify this metric before selecting a NudgeAI plan.
            1.  **Access Shopify Admin Panel:** Log in to your Shopify store admin page.
            2.  **Navigate to Analytics:** Click on **'Analytics'** in the left-hand menu.
            3.  **Check the 'Visitors over time' Report:**
                *   On the Analytics page, look for the report card titled **"Visitors over time."** This is the key metric showing the trend in your store's visitor numbers.
                *   ![Shopify Visitors Over Time Report](../../../assets/images/visitor_02.png)
                *   Use the date filter in the top right of the report card to set the period to **'Last month'** or a specific range (e.g., the last 30 days) to determine the total visitors or daily/weekly trends. This data typically helps in understanding the average monthly visitor volume.
            4.  **If the 'Visitors over time' Report is Not Visible (How to Add the Report):**
                *   Click the **"Customize"** button in the top right of the Analytics page.
                *   In the panel that appears on the left, type **"visitors over time"** into the search bar at the top.
                *   When the "Visitors over time" report appears in the search results, click or select it to add it to your current Analytics dashboard.

        *   (Note: In Shopify Analytics, 'Sessions' refer to a group of user interactions within a given time frame and may differ slightly from unique visitors. However, the 'Visitors over time' report is generally sufficient for gauging monthly traffic volume and as a reference for NudgeAI plan selection.)
*   **Monthly Estimated Email Collection Goal:** How many 'High-value' emails do you aim to acquire per month?
*   **Need for Additional Features & Support Level:** Besides basic email collection, do you foresee needing more advanced features or priority technical support in the future? (Currently, all plans offer the same core features, but plan-specific advanced features may be added later.)
