# Login Page Enhancement (Legacy Accounts)

If your Shopify store uses the **'Classic (Legacy) Customer Accounts'** system, NudgeAI significantly improves the login and sign-up experience for your customers, while simultaneously helping you effortlessly secure highly valuable customer information.

NudgeAI enhances your store's login and sign-up pages in the following ways:

1.  **Direct Application of 'Continue with Google' Button**:
    *   Traditional Shopify login/sign-up pages require customers to manually enter their email address and password. NudgeAI **prominently adds a 'Continue with Google' button** to these pages.
    *   <img src="../../assets/images/login.png" alt="'Continue with Google' button example on login page" style="width: 50%;">
    *   This button offers customers a much faster and more convenient alternative, reducing the hassle of manual data entry.

2.  **Ultra-Simple Login/Sign-up via Google One Tap with a Single Click**:
    *   When a customer clicks the 'Continue with Google' button, the **Google One Tap feature is immediately executed**.
    *   This allows customers to **securely and quickly log in or sign up as a new member with a single click** using their existing Google account, eliminating the need to create or remember new usernames and passwords.

3.  **Simultaneous Acquisition of 'High-value Customer Information'**:
    *   During this streamlined Google One Tap process, NudgeAI automatically and accurately collects the following core 'High-value customer information':
        *   **100% Verified Email Address**: The customer's actual Google account email.
        *   **Customer's Full Name (First + Last)**: The accurate name information registered with their Google account.
        *   **Explicit Email Marketing Consent**: This is detailed in the "[Login Page: Marketing Consent Configuration (Legacy)](login-page-consent-config-legacy.md)" document.

!!! warning "Note: Difference from New Customer Accounts"
    In Shopify's 'New Customer Accounts' system, NudgeAI does not directly add a button to the login/sign-up pages. In that environment, customer information is primarily collected through the AI Plus Pop-up and AI Lite Pop-up.

**In conclusion, NudgeAI revolutionizes the login/sign-up pages for stores using 'Classic (Legacy) Customer Accounts' as follows:**

*   **For Customers**: Maximizes convenience by providing a password-free, ultra-simple one-click login/sign-up experience.
*   **For Stores**: Enables the acquisition of accurate emails, full names, and clear marketing consent all at once through voluntary customer participation, laying the foundation for a high-quality customer database and effective personalized marketing.
