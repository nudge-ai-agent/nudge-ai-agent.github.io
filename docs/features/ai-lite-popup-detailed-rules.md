# AI Lite Pop-up: Detailed Display & Closing/Re-display Rules

NudgeAI's **AI Lite Pop-up** is designed to encourage newsletter subscriptions and information provision naturally while minimally disrupting the customer's shopping experience. To achieve this, it follows detailed display, closing, and re-display rules as outlined below.

## 1. Basic Display Conditions

*   **Operating Environment**: The AI Lite Pop-up works on **both desktop PCs and mobile devices**.
*   **Display Pages**: It is generally displayed to customers on the store's **main page** and **product detail pages**.
*   **Display Method (Scroll-Based)**:
    *   When a customer visits a relevant page and scrolls down, consuming content, the AI Lite Pop-up gently appears at the bottom of the screen once they have scrolled approximately **50% of the page**.
    *   This is intended to display the pop-up when the customer has shown a certain level of interest in the page content, minimizing abrupt interruptions and encouraging natural interaction.

## 2. Pop-up Disappearance Conditions and Re-display Rules

*   **Pop-up Disappearance**: The AI Lite Pop-up does not have a separate close button ('X' button), nor does it close when clicking outside the pop-up area. The pop-up will disappear from the screen in the following cases:
    *   When the customer **navigates to a different page** from the one where the pop-up is displayed.
    *   When the customer **refreshes the current page**.
*   **Re-display Rules**:
    *   After the pop-up has disappeared due to page navigation or refresh, it may reappear if the customer revisits the page and meets the display conditions again (e.g., scrolling 50%). (This is unless other non-display conditions, mentioned below, apply).

## 3. Non-Display Conditions Based on Customer Actions and Status

To provide an optimal experience, NudgeAI limits the display of the AI Lite Pop-up in the following cases:

*   **Customers who have already successfully provided information/logged in via NudgeAI**:
    *   If a customer has previously **successfully completed** the Google One Tap process by clicking the **AI Plus Pop-up, AI Lite Pop-up, or (for stores using Shopify 'Classic (Legacy) customer accounts') the 'Continue with Google' button on the login page** (meaning their name, email, and marketing consent information have been processed through NudgeAI, or they have logged in this way), the **AI Lite Pop-up will no longer be displayed to that customer.**
    *   This is to avoid redundant pop-up displays for customers who have already completed a key interaction with NudgeAI (e.g., providing information, subscribing, logging in).

!!! note "Additional Considerations for Shopify Customer Account Types"
    The display of the AI Lite Pop-up can also be partially influenced by the customer's Shopify **login status** and the store's **customer account settings ('Classic Legacy' or 'New')**. For more details, please refer to the "[AI Lite Pop-up: Behavior by Account Type & Login Status](ai-lite-popup-account-type-behavior.md)" document.

These rules are designed to provide customers with a pleasant shopping experience by reducing unnecessary repetitive displays, while offering the store opportunities to encourage voluntary information provision at the most appropriate moments. (Specific rules may be subject to change with service updates.)
