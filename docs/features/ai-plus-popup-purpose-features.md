# AI Plus Pop-up: Purpose & Key Features

NudgeAI's **AI Plus Pop-up** is a **mobile-only** pop-up feature primarily aimed at **maximizing email subscription rates** from store visitors and effectively **securing the most valuable customer information (full name, 100% verified email, marketing consent)**. It's designed to respect the customer's shopping experience while appearing at crucial moments to encourage easy information provision.

## Key Features of AI Plus Pop-up

The main features of the AI Plus Pop-up are as follows:

1.  **Fully Optimized for Mobile Environments**:
    *   The AI Plus Pop-up is displayed **only to customers accessing via mobile devices** such as smartphones or tablets.
    *   It is designed so customers can comfortably view information and participate easily, even on small screens.

2.  **Conspicuous Yet Familiar Bottom Notification Design**:
    *   The AI Plus Pop-up typically appears at the bottom of the screen with the size and design of the Google One Tap interface.
    *   <img src="../../assets/images/aipluspoppup.png" alt="AI Plus Pop-up Example" style="width: 50%;">
    *   This ensures it doesn't excessively cover the customer's screen while not missing important information acquisition opportunities, and it provides **familiarity and trustworthiness** to customers accustomed to Google services, reducing resistance to the pop-up.

3.  **Executes Google One Tap Immediately on Click**:
    *   The AI Plus Pop-up is not just a simple notification banner. When a customer clicks (or taps) the pop-up (banner), the **Google One Tap feature is immediately executed**.
    *   This allows customers to easily log in or sign up via their Google account on the spot, providing necessary information (email, full name, marketing consent) without needing to navigate to a separate page or enter complex information.

4.  **Simultaneous Acquisition of High-Quality Core Information**:
    *   Through the pop-up click and the ensuing Google One Tap process, the store can acquire the customer's **100% verified email address, accurate full name (first + last), and explicit email subscription consent** all at once and very effectively.

5.  **Respects User Choice (Close Function)**:
    *   The AI Plus Pop-up respects customer choices. It provides a clear option (e.g., an 'X' button) for customers who do not want the pop-up to easily close it. (Detailed behavior rules when closed are described in the "AI Plus Pop-up: Display Conditions & Rules" document.)

**In conclusion, the purpose of the AI Plus Pop-up** is to maximize the store's "High-value Email" collection performance by providing an optimized, convenient, and trustworthy Google One Tap experience for mobile users.
