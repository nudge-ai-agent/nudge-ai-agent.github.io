# AI Lite Pop-up: Behavior by Account Type & Login Status

NudgeAI's AI Lite Pop-up operates in all PC and mobile environments, aiming to gently support the customer's shopping experience. Thanks to these characteristics, it can be flexibly utilized to approach customers in various ways and effectively collect necessary information, depending on the store's customer account setup (Classic Legacy or New) and the customer's current login status.

## 1. For Stores Using "Classic (Legacy) Customer Accounts"

*   **For non-loggedin customers**:
    *   The AI Lite Pop-up appears according to general display rules (e.g., displayed at the bottom when scrolling about 50% of the main page or product detail page), encouraging easy newsletter subscription and information provision (name, email) via Google One Tap.
*   **For logged-in customers (Supplementing existing member information and obtaining consent)**:
    *   In a Classic (Legacy) account environment, it's highly probable that the customer is already a registered member of the store. However, if they were active before NudgeAI was introduced or didn't use the 'Continue with Google' button on the sign-up/login page, the store might not yet have secured their accurate full name or the latest marketing consent status.
    *   **This is where the AI Lite Pop-up plays a crucial role.** Even for logged-in existing customers, if their full name hasn't been updated via NudgeAI, or if they haven't given explicit consent for newsletter subscription (marketing communication), the AI Lite Pop-up can gently appear, proposing something like "Subscribe to our newsletter and get the latest news," and provide an opportunity to supplement this information or obtain new consent via Google One Tap.
    *   This is a way to naturally complete 'High-value customer information' without burdening the customer.
    *   (*However, if the customer has already provided all necessary information (name, email, marketing consent) through any of NudgeAI's features and successfully completed the subscription, the AI Lite Pop-up will no longer be displayed.*)

## 2. For Stores Using "New Customer Accounts"

*   **For non-loggedin customers**:
    *   Similar to the Classic (Legacy) account environment, the AI Lite Pop-up appears according to general display rules to encourage information provision and newsletter subscription via Google One Tap.
*   **For logged-in customers**:
    *   In the new customer account system, even if a customer has logged in using Shopify's default method (email and 6-digit code), it doesn't mean they have completed providing their full name or consented to marketing/newsletter subscriptions via NudgeAI.
    *   Therefore, **even for logged-in customers, if their name information has not yet been collected via NudgeAI or if they have not consented to a newsletter subscription, the AI Lite Pop-up will be displayed** to provide an opportunity to collect this information and obtain subscription consent via Google One Tap.
    *   This serves a similar purpose to the AI Plus Pop-up, but the AI Lite Pop-up also works in PC environments and approaches in a gentler manner.
    *   (*However, if the customer has already provided all necessary information (name, email, marketing consent) through any of NudgeAI's features and successfully completed the subscription, or successfully logged in via Google One Tap through AI Plus/Lite pop-ups, the AI Lite Pop-up will no longer be displayed.*)

## 3. General Non-Display Conditions Applicable in All Cases

*   The most important principle is that **if a customer has successfully completed the Google One Tap process through any of NudgeAI's features (AI Plus Pop-up, AI Lite Pop-up, or the login page button in Legacy accounts) and provided all the core information the store needs (name, verified email, marketing/newsletter subscription consent), the AI Lite Pop-up (and AI Plus Pop-up) will no longer be redundantly displayed to that customer.**
*   This is to avoid repetitive requests to customers who have already provided their information and to offer a pleasant user experience.

As such, the AI Lite Pop-up is an important feature that works flexibly according to various customer situations, helping stores carefully secure even easily missed customer information.
