# AI Lite Pop-up: Marketing Consent Process

NudgeAI's AI Lite Pop-up is designed to effectively secure **'High-value customer data'**—a core NudgeAI objective—while smoothly supporting the customer's shopping experience. 'High-value customer data' here means more than just an email address; it includes the **customer's full name, a 100% verified email, and explicit consent for newsletter subscription (marketing communication)**.

When obtaining this information through the AI Lite Pop-up, the customer's marketing/newsletter subscription consent is processed as follows:

1.  **Clear Value Proposition and Subscription Prompt within the Pop-up**:
    *   The AI Lite Pop-up includes a clear message stating the value the customer receives by subscribing to the newsletter, such as **"Subscribe to our newsletter. Get the latest updates first."**
    *   <img src="../../assets/images/AILitePop-up.png" alt="AI Lite Pop-up Example" style="width: 50%;">
    *   This message naturally guides the customer to agree to a **clear action of newsletter subscription** and provide necessary information via Google One Tap, rather than just clicking a pop-up.

2.  **"Subscribe" Button Click = Easy Information Provision via Google One Tap & Subscription Consent**:
    *   When the customer clicks the "Subscribe" button on the AI Lite Pop-up, NudgeAI's core technology, the **Google One Tap interface, is immediately launched**.
    *   This allows the customer to effortlessly provide their **accurate full name and 100% verified email address** from their Google account to the store with a single click, without cumbersome data entry.
    *   Simultaneously, by clicking, the customer is considered to have agreed to the "newsletter subscription" offer stated in the pop-up, and **marketing/newsletter consent is processed concurrently without a separate checkbox selection process**. The Google One Tap interface itself does not display an additional consent checkbox, making the customer experience very streamlined.

3.  **Accurately Recorded as 'Subscribed' in Shopify**:
    *   Once the customer completes the Google One Tap process, NudgeAI accurately records the collected name and email information along with the customer's marketing consent status as **'Subscribed' in the Shopify customer information**.

!!! info "Conclusion: Core Concepts of AI Lite Pop-up's Marketing Consent"
    The marketing consent process for the AI Lite Pop-up reflects NudgeAI's core concepts:
    *   **Prioritizing Customer Experience**: Enables information provision and subscription in the easiest, most frictionless way through Google One Tap.
    *   **Clear Intent Confirmation**: Ensures customers clearly understand what they are consenting to (newsletter subscription) through the pop-up's own wording.
    *   **Securing High-Quality Information**: Through this entire process, the store acquires 'High-value customer information,' which includes not just an email, but also a full name and clear subscription intent.

!!! note "Relationship with NudgeAI App's Central Settings"
    This consent method in the AI Lite Pop-up operates **independently** of the central "Marketing Consent Settings" in the NudgeAI app. (The "Marketing Consent Settings" primarily affect the consent UI at the bottom of the 'Continue with Google' button on the login/signup page when using Shopify 'Classic (Legacy) customer accounts'.) This is to provide the optimal consent acquisition method tailored to the characteristics of each customer touchpoint.
