# AI Lite Pop-up: Introduction & Comparison

NudgeAI offers two types of pop-ups, **AI Plus Pop-up** and **AI Lite Pop-up**, to cater to various store situations and marketing goals. The AI Lite Pop-up focuses on gently approaching customers without significantly disrupting their shopping experience, aiming to naturally obtain valuable customer information (full name, verified email, newsletter subscription consent).

## Key Features of AI Lite Pop-up

1.  **Works on All Devices (PC and Mobile)**:
    *   Unlike the mobile-only AI Plus Pop-up, the AI Lite Pop-up can be displayed to customers on **both desktop PCs and mobile devices**. This allows you to reach a broader range of visitors.

2.  **Less Intrusive, Gentle Display Method**:
    *   The AI Lite Pop-up generally appears less aggressively than the AI Plus Pop-up. For example, it might gently appear at the bottom of the page when a customer has scrolled about **50% of the main page or a product details page**, encouraging subscription naturally without significantly interrupting the shopping experience.

3.  **Clear Value Proposition and Simple Click-Through Design**:
    *   The left side of the pop-up includes a clear message conveying the value to the customer, such as **"Subscribe to our newsletter. Get the latest updates first."**
    *   The right side features a **button with the Google logo and the text "Subscribe,"** guiding the customer to easily proceed to the next step with a single click.

4.  **Executes Google One Tap on Click for Information/Consent**:
    *   When a customer clicks the "Subscribe" button, the **Google One Tap feature is immediately executed**, similar to the AI Plus Pop-up.
    *   This allows customers to easily provide their name and email information and consent to newsletter subscription (i.e., marketing communication) as indicated in the pop-up text. No separate marketing consent checkbox is displayed within the Google One Tap interface (consent is implied by the pop-up text and click action).
