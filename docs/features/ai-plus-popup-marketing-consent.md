# AI Plus Pop-up: Marketing Consent Process

NudgeAI's AI Plus Pop-up not only prompts customers to easily provide their name and email information via Google One Tap but also **clearly handles marketing consent through the instructive text on the pop-up banner itself.**

## Marketing Consent Method in AI Plus Pop-up

The marketing consent method in the AI Plus Pop-up is as follows:

1.  **Clear Prior Notification within the Pop-up Banner**:
    *   The AI Plus Pop-up banner includes clear instructive text such as **"By clicking Continue, you'll get news and offers by email."**
    *   This text clearly informs the customer in advance that clicking the pop-up (banner) to proceed to the next step (Google One Tap information provision) also signifies their consent to receive email marketing information.

2.  **Consent Assumed on Pop-up Click & Google One Tap Execution**:
    *   When a customer clicks (or taps) the AI Plus Pop-up banner containing this instructive text, they are **considered to have consented** to the marketing information reception condition, and the Google One Tap interface immediately appears on the screen.

3.  **No Separate Consent Checkbox within Google One Tap Interface**:
    *   The Google One Tap interface executed via the AI Plus Pop-up only displays the UI for customer information verification and provision; **it does not show a separate checkbox for marketing consent.** This is because the customer's consent intent regarding this matter is already confirmed by clicking the pop-up banner.

4.  **Information Collection and Recorded as 'Marketing Subscribed'**:
    *   Once the customer selects their Google account and finally completes the provision of their name and email information, NudgeAI accurately records the collected information along with the customer's marketing consent status as **'Subscribed' in the Shopify customer information**.

!!! info "Note: Relationship with NudgeAI App's Central Settings"
    The marketing consent process through the AI Plus Pop-up operates **independently** of the central "Marketing Consent Settings" in the NudgeAI app. Consent is processed based on the clear instructive text on the pop-up banner itself.
    (The "Marketing Consent Settings" primarily affect the consent UI at the bottom of the 'Continue with Google' button on the login/signup page when using Shopify 'Classic (Legacy) customer accounts'.)

This is to provide customers with clear awareness of marketing information reception simultaneously with the pop-up click and to obtain high-quality customer information and marketing consent together in the most streamlined manner.
