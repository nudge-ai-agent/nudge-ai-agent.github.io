## 1. Display Environment: Where Can You See It?

*   **Supports All PC and Mobile Environments**: One of the biggest advantages of the AI Lite Pop-up is that it **works on both desktop PCs and mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, etc.)**. This allows you to offer NudgeAI's convenient information collection features to a wider range of visitors.

## 2. Display Design: What Does It Look Like?

*   **Fixed Bar Form at the Bottom of the Page**: The AI Lite Pop-up typically appears as a **fixed bar at the bottom of the screen**. This design allows the pop-up to remain in a specific position on the screen even when the customer scrolls, delivering its message gently without obscuring the main page content.
*   **Concise and Clear Composition**:
    *   **Left Text Area**: A **clear and concise message** that conveys value to the customer or encourages action is displayed, such as "Subscribe to our newsletter. Get the latest updates first."
    *   **Right Button Area**: A **click-to-action button with the Google logo and the text "Subscribe"** visually guides the customer to easily proceed to the next step. The button design is considered to be eye-catching yet harmonious with the overall page design.
    *   **User Experience Focused**: Overall, the AI Lite Pop-up adopts a clean and modern design that focuses on effectively delivering necessary information and functionality without excessively occupying the customer's screen or causing visual burden.

## 3. Display Method (Reference)

*   The AI Lite Pop-up generally does not appear immediately when a customer enters a page. Instead, it gently appears when certain conditions are met (e.g., when the customer **scrolls about 50% of the main page or a product details page**), encouraging interaction within the customer's natural flow. (Detailed display conditions are covered in the "[AI Lite Pop-up: Detailed Display & Closing/Re-display Rules](ai-lite-popup-detailed-rules.md)" document.)

Thus, the AI Lite Pop-up supports various access environments and helps maintain a positive brand experience by effectively collecting customer information through a sophisticated design that does not obstruct the customer's view.
