# eBay Success Story

## Company Overview

eBay is one of the world's largest e-commerce marketplaces, connecting millions of buyers and sellers globally. Founded in 1995, the platform hosts billions of listings across countless categories, from collectibles to electronics and fashion.

## Challenges Before NudgeAI

As a mature platform, eBay faced several significant challenges with their authentication system:

- **Login abandonment**: High drop-off rates during authentication, particularly on mobile devices.

  > "We were losing a substantial number of potential transactions when users encountered login screens," explains Jason Chen, User Experience Director at eBay.

- **Cross-device friction**: Users struggled to maintain sessions across different devices and browsers.

  > "Our data showed that nearly 50% of users who started shopping on mobile would abandon their journey when asked to log in again on desktop."

- **Mobile conversion gap**: Mobile conversion rates significantly lagged behind desktop, despite growing mobile traffic.

  > "Mobile represented over 60% of our traffic but only 40% of completed transactions, with authentication being a major friction point."

- **Inactive accounts**: Many accounts remained dormant after initial creation.

  > "We had millions of registered accounts that showed little to no activity after signup, suggesting users created accounts but didn't find enough value to return."

## Benefits for the Marketing Team

After implementing Google One Tap Login, eBay's marketing and growth teams saw immediate advantages:

- **Enhanced user journey mapping**: "We can now track real users across their entire shopping journey, giving us much better insights into conversion paths."

- **Improved remarketing efficiency**: "Email campaigns to Google-authenticated users show 38% higher open rates and 42% better conversion than our traditional account base."

- **Better user segmentation**: "The verified nature of Google accounts gives us more confidence in our segmentation models and personalization efforts."

- **Mobile strategy enhancement**: "We've been able to significantly improve our mobile marketing strategy now that the authentication gap is closing."

## User Experience Improvements

The impact on the user experience was immediately noticeable:

- **Seamless re-engagement**: Users can return to eBay with a single tap instead of remembering passwords

- **Cross-device continuity**: Shopping carts and preferences sync automatically across devices 

- **Reduced form fatigue**: New users skip lengthy registration forms
