# Redfin Success Story

## Company Overview

Redfin is a technology-powered real estate company that combines a full-service experience with modern technology. Founded in 2004, Redfin has grown to become one of the most-visited real estate platforms in the United States, offering home buying, selling, and rental services with lower fees and a customer-centric approach.

## Challenges Before NudgeAI

Before implementing Google One Tap Login, Redfin faced several key challenges in their user authentication and engagement strategy:

- **High-value feature gating**: Critical features like saving homes and receiving price alerts required account creation.

  > "We found that 82% of users were abandoning the registration process when trying to save their first property," explains Michelle Davis, Conversion Director at Redfin.

- **Long property search cycles**: Home buying typically involves weeks or months of searching, requiring long-term user identification.

  > "The average home buyer spends 10 weeks searching for properties, often across multiple devices and sessions. Without persistent accounts, we couldn't provide continuity."

- **Verification requirements**: The real estate industry demands reliable user verification for agent connections.

  > "When users request tours or agent contact, we need verified identities, but our multi-step verification was causing 63% of users to drop off."

- **Mobile app transition friction**: Moving users from mobile web to app installation involved complex authentication handoffs.

  > "The authentication gap between web and app experiences was our biggest source of user loss during platform transitions."

## Benefits for the Marketing Team

After implementing Google One Tap Login, Redfin's marketing team saw immediate advantages:

- **Improved lead quality**: "The verified nature of Google accounts gives us much higher confidence in lead authenticity."

- **Enhanced remarketing capabilities**: "Email campaigns to Google-authenticated users show 47% higher open rates and 68% better click-through rates."

- **Better attribution modeling**: "We can now accurately track users across their entire home buying journey, from first search to closing."

- **Increased app adoption**: "The seamless transition from web to app authentication has boosted app installations by 42%."

## User Experience Improvements

The user experience improvements were particularly valuable in the complex home buying journey:

- **Seamless property saving**: One-tap access to saving favorite properties

- **Cross-device search continuity**: Home searches remain synchronized across mobile, desktop, and app

- **Agent connection confidence**: Users feel more comfortable connecting with agents through verified accounts

- **Personalized recommendations**: More relevant property suggestions based on search history

> "The simplified login has transformed how people engage with our platform. Now that saving homes is practically frictionless, we're seeing much deeper engagement throughout the entire home search process." - User Experience Director
