# Zapier Success Story

## Company Overview

Zapier is a leading automation platform that connects over 5,000 apps and services, allowing users to automate workflows without coding knowledge. Founded in 2011, Zapier serves millions of users from small businesses to enterprise organizations who use the platform to save time and improve productivity.

## Challenges Before NudgeAI

Before implementing Google One Tap Login, Zapier faced several unique challenges in their user acquisition and activation process:

- **Complex onboarding journey**: Users needed to connect multiple apps and create workflows, making the initial experience potentially overwhelming.

  > "Our data showed that 57% of new users who created accounts would drop off before creating their first successful automation," notes Jessica Wong, Growth Lead at Zapier.

- **Technical intimidation**: Despite being a no-code tool, many potential users perceived Zapier as technically complex.

  > "We found that the traditional registration process added another layer of friction to what some users already considered a technical challenge."

- **B2B adoption barriers**: Team implementation required multiple members to create accounts, multiplying any registration friction.

  > "When one team member struggled with account creation, it often delayed or derailed entire team adoption."

- **Password fatigue**: Business users already managed dozens of SaaS product credentials.

  > "In exit surveys, 34% of abandoned signups mentioned 'too many passwords to remember' as a contributing factor to not completing their Zapier setup."

## Benefits for the Marketing Team

After implementing Google One Tap Login, Zapier's marketing team saw significant advantages:

- **Simplified acquisition funnel**: "We've removed a major drop-off point in our user journey, making all acquisition efforts more effective."

- **Better attribution accuracy**: "With more reliable user identification, our campaign attribution has become much more precise."

- **Improved cross-selling**: "Verified users allow us to better recommend appropriate plan upgrades based on their usage patterns."

- **Enhanced team adoption**: "We've seen much higher success rates when companies invite multiple team members to the platform."

## User Experience Improvements

The user experience improvements were particularly valuable for a productivity tool like Zapier:

- **Faster time to value**: Users reach their first successful automation more quickly

- **Reduced cognitive load**: One less password to create and remember

- **Seamless team collaboration**: Team members join workspaces instantly

- **Cross-device workflow building**: Users can start a workflow on one device and continue on another

> "Our product is all about saving time and reducing friction in workflows. Google One Tap Login applies that same philosophy to our own user experience, creating immediate trust with new users." - User Research Director
