# BOLT Clothing Success Story

## Company Overview

BOLT Clothing is a European sports fashion retailer that offers premium athletic wear for various activities. Founded in 2015, they've grown rapidly to serve customers across 12 countries with a focus on quality sports apparel and accessories.

## Challenges Before NudgeAI

Before implementing NudgeAI, BOLT Clothing faced several critical challenges:

- **Low-quality email subscribers**: "We were collecting thousands of email addresses, but only 12% ever opened our emails. Many were fake addresses or created just to get discounts," says Emma Lawson, Marketing Director.

- **Complicated signup process**: Customer feedback consistently highlighted frustration with their multi-step registration:
  
  > "The form is too long, I just wanted to check out quickly." - Customer feedback survey
  
  > "I gave up creating an account because it took too many steps." - Abandoned cart survey

- **High cart abandonment**: Internal analytics showed 72% of potential customers abandoned carts when asked to create an account during checkout.

- **Poor email marketing ROI**: Despite spending €8,000 monthly on email campaigns, conversion rates remained below 0.8%.

## Benefits for the Marketing Team

After implementing Google One Tap Login and Smart Popups with NudgeAI:

- **Reduced workload**: "We've eliminated hours spent configuring popup rules and analyzing what works."
