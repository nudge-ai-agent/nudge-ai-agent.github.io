# Hipmunk Success Story

## Company Overview

Hipmunk was an innovative travel search platform that simplified the process of finding flights, hotels, cars, and vacation packages. Founded in 2010, Hipmunk differentiated itself through a user-friendly interface that sorted results by an "agony" factor rather than just price, taking into account duration, layovers, and other convenience metrics.

## Challenges Before NudgeAI

Before implementing Google One Tap Login, Hipmunk faced several challenges in their user authentication and engagement strategy:

- **Search abandonment**: Users abandoned the platform when asked to create accounts to save itineraries.

  > "We saw that 72% of users would leave rather than create an account, even after spending considerable time crafting the perfect itinerary," explains Ryan Garcia, former Product Manager at Hipmunk.

- **Multi-device travel planning**: Users typically researched travel on multiple devices but lost their progress when switching.

  > "Our analytics showed that travel planning often started on mobile during commutes but continued on desktop later, with most users unable to transfer their searches."

- **Price alert subscription barriers**: Critical features like price drop notifications required account creation.

  > "Price alerts were among our most valuable features, but the signup requirement was preventing wider adoption."

- **Competitive loss**: Users would find flights on Hipmunk but book elsewhere due to account friction.

  > "Exit surveys showed that many users who left without booking had found suitable options but were deterred by the registration requirement to save or share their findings."

## Benefits for the Marketing Team

After implementing Google One Tap Login, Hipmunk's marketing team experienced significant advantages:

- **Enhanced user tracking**: "We could finally connect user journeys across sessions and devices for more accurate analytics."

- **Improved email marketing**: "Our price alert emails saw a 320% increase in engagement with verified Gmail accounts."

- **Better segmentation**: "With reliable user identification, our destination and price-point targeting became much more accurate."

- **Higher retention rates**: "We could build longer relationships with travelers instead of treating each visit as a new anonymous session."

## User Experience Improvements

The user experience improvements were particularly valuable in the complex travel planning process:

- **Seamless itinerary saving**: One-click access to save flight and hotel combinations

- **Cross-device continuity**: Travel searches remained accessible across all devices

- **Personalized recommendations**: More relevant travel suggestions based on search history

- **Frictionless price alerts**: Instant setup of fare drop notifications with a single tap

> "The ability to seamlessly continue a travel search across devices completely transformed how people used our platform. What used to require copying details or starting over became completely invisible to users." - UX Designer
