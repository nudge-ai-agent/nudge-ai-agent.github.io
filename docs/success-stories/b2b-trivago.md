# Trivago Success Story

## Company Overview

Trivago is a global hotel search platform that compares rates from over 5 million hotels and hundreds of booking sites. Founded in 2005 in Düsseldorf, Germany, Trivago has grown to serve travelers in more than 190 countries, helping them find ideal accommodations at the best prices.

## Challenges Before NudgeAI

Trivago faced several challenges with their user authentication and personalization strategy:

- **High-intent user loss**: Users researching trips often abandoned the process when asked to create accounts.

  > "We were losing valuable high-intent searchers at the point of asking them to register," explains Andreas Müller, User Experience Director at Trivago.

- **Cross-device search continuity**: Travel planning typically happens across multiple devices and sessions.

  > "Our data showed that 68% of travelers use multiple devices when researching trips, but we couldn't connect these journeys without account creation."

- **Personalization limitations**: Without user accounts, Trivago couldn't fully leverage their recommendation algorithms.

  > "We knew personalized recommendations could increase booking rates by 26%, but we needed user accounts to deliver this experience."

- **Mobile conversion gap**: Mobile users were much less likely to create accounts despite representing the majority of traffic.

  > "Mobile represented 74% of our traffic, but conversion rates to registered users were just one-third of desktop rates."

## Benefits for the Marketing Team

After implementing Google One Tap Login, Trivago's marketing team experienced significant advantages:

- **Enhanced user journey tracking**: "We can now follow the complete user path from initial search to booking across multiple sessions and devices."

- **Improved remarketing efficiency**: "Email campaigns to authenticated users show 41% higher engagement than our previous unauthenticated targeting."

- **Better segmentation**: "With more reliable user profiles, our market segmentation has become much more precise."

- **Increased lifetime value**: "We've seen a 34% increase in lifetime value from authenticated users due to improved personalization."

## User Experience Improvements

The user experience improvements were substantial:

- **Seamless search continuity**: Users can continue searches across devices without starting over

- **Personalized recommendations**: More relevant hotel options based on previous searches

- **Saved preferences**: No need to re-enter travel dates, destinations, or filters

- **Price alerts**: Authenticated users receive alerts when prices drop for saved properties

> "The ability to continue a hotel search across devices has transformed how travelers use our platform. What used to be a frustrating experience of starting over is now completely seamless." - User Research Lead
