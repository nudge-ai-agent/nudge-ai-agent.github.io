# 5-Minute Setup: Start Growing Your Email List Today ðŸš€

Getting NudgeAI up and running is super easy! Follow these simple steps and you'll be collecting high-quality email subscribers in no time.

## Before You Start

You'll need:
- Your Shopify store (of course!)
- Admin access to your store
- About 5 minutes of your time (really, it's that quick!)

## 1. Get the App on Your Store

1. Visit the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/)
2. Search "NudgeAI-email" (or [click here for direct link](https://apps.shopify.com/))
3. Click "Add app"
4. Review permissions and click "Install"

> **ðŸ’¡ Quick Win**: While other email collection tools can take hours to set up, NudgeAI typically takes just 5 minutes from installation to collecting your first subscriber!

## 2. One Important Shopify Setting (Don't Skip This!)

To unlock all the conversion-boosting power of Google One Tap login:

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Settings**
2. Click **Customer accounts** in the left menu
3. Under account options, select **Legacy**
4. Click **Save**

!!! warning "Must-Do Step"
    The "Log in with a one-time code" option won't work with our powerful Google One Tap login feature. Legacy mode is required for the highest conversion rates.

## 3. Activate the Magic (Enable App Embed)

Let's add our subscriber-generating code to your store:

1. In your new NudgeAI dashboard, click the **App Settings** tab
2. Find "App Embed" and click the **Enable** button
3. That's it! Our code is now automatically inserted into your theme

> **ðŸ”¥ Conversion Booster**: Stores using our Google One Tap login feature see an average 600% increase in account creation! This step activates that powerful feature.

## 4. Quick Test (Make Sure Everything's Working)

Let's make sure your money-making features are live:

1. Open your store in an incognito or private browsing window
2. Check that you see:
   - Google login buttons on signup pages
   - Google login buttons on login pages
   - Smart popups appearing naturally as you browse
3. Watch your dashboard as new subscribers start flowing in!

## Having Trouble?

- **Theme changes?** Re-enable app embed in dashboard settings
