# Email Limits Management

Nudge AI plans have limits on the number of high-value emails you can collect each month. Understanding your current usage and remaining limit is important for using the service.

## What is the Email Limit?

- **Monthly Basis**: Each Nudge AI subscription plan defines the maximum number of high-value emails collectible per month.
- **Limit Reset**: This limit automatically resets each month on your Shopify app billing date.
- **No Rollover**: Unused email collection capacity from a given month does not carry over to the next month.

## How to Check Usage and Remaining Limit

You can check your current email collection usage and the remaining amount against your plan limit on the **Nudge AI app dashboard**.

- **Dashboard Metric**: The 'Remaining Quota' metric on the [Dashboard](../dashboard/index.md) provides a visual representation of your current status.
- **Usage Alerts**: Automatic notifications may be sent to your Shopify account email when certain percentages of the monthly limit are reached (e.g., 75%, 90%, 100%). (Alert feature may be available in future updates.)

## When the Limit is Reached

For details on what happens when you reach your monthly email collection limit, please refer to the [Handling Limit Reached](../limit-handling/index.md) page.
