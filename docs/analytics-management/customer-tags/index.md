# Using Shopify Customer Tags

Nudge AI automatically adds a specific tag to Shopify customer profiles when they sign up through the service. You can utilize this tag to easily identify customers acquired via Nudge AI and use it for marketing activities.

## Understanding the Nudge AI Tag

- **Automatic Tag**: When a customer signs up through Nudge AI (via Google One Tap popup or the sign-up/login page), the tag **`Nudge AI`** is automatically added to their Shopify profile.
- **Purpose**: This tag is used to identify the customer's acquisition channel (Nudge AI).

### 3. Analytics and Reporting
