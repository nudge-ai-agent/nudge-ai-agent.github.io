# Handling Limit Reached

When you reach the monthly high-value email collection limit of your selected Nudge AI plan, there will be changes in how some features operate. This page guides you on what happens when the limit is reached and the options available.

## Limit Reached Notifications

- You may receive notifications via your Shopify account email when certain percentages of the monthly email collection limit are reached (e.g., 75%, 90%).
- You will receive a final notification upon reaching 100% of the limit.

## Feature Behavior When Limit is Reached

Upon reaching 100% of the monthly email collection limit:

- **Nudge Smart Pop-up Feature Limited**: The Nudge Smart Pop-up will no longer be displayed to visitors, temporarily pausing new email collection via the popup.
- **Sign-up/Login Page Feature Maintained**: The Google One Tap interface applied to your store's sign-up/login page will continue to function normally. Visitors can still easily sign up or log in through this pathway.

## Available Options

When the limit is reached, consider the following options:

1.  **Upgrade to a Higher Plan**: If you need to collect more emails immediately, you can upgrade to a higher plan through the [Change Plan](../../account-policy/change-plan/index.md) page. The new limit applies instantly upon upgrading.
2.  **Wait for the Next Cycle**: The monthly email collection limit automatically resets on your next Shopify app billing date. Waiting until then will enable email collection via the Nudge Smart Pop-up again.
3.  **Inquire about Enterprise Custom Plan**: If you consistently need to acquire more than 250 high-value emails per month, you can contact the Nudge AI [Support Team](../../support-troubleshooting/contact/index.md) to inquire about customized enterprise solutions.

You can check your current plan limit and usage on the [Nudge AI Dashboard](../dashboard/index.md).
