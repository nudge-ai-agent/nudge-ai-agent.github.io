# Conversion Analytics

Nudge AI plans to offer detailed conversion analytics features for email acquisition in future updates.

## Planned Metrics (Examples)

- **Conversion Rate from Popup Exposure**: The rate at which Nudge Smart Popups actually lead to email acquisition.
- **Sign-up Page Conversion Rate**: The rate of actual sign-up completions via Google One Tap compared to visits to the sign-up/login page.
- **Source Conversion Comparison**: Comparing the conversion performance between the popup and the sign-up page pathways.

## Current Status

The conversion analytics feature is currently under development and is not yet available on the dashboard. We will announce updates as the feature becomes ready.

You can currently check your email collection performance on the [Nudge AI Dashboard](../dashboard/index.md).
