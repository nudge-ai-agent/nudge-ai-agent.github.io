This permission is necessary to accurately record the collected customer information in your Shopify customer database, register them as new customers, or update existing customer information. (While NudgeAI does not currently collect/use phone numbers or physical addresses directly, this permission covers standard fields that may be part of Shopify's customer data structure.)</li> <li>Access to Store Owner Information: This may be needed during the initial app setup process or for customer support to verify basic information required for store operation, or to deliver important app-related announcements.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>View and edit store data</p> <ul> <li>Details (Example): Edit customers (Customer data)</li> <li>Why it's needed: This permission is required to create new entries or update existing information in your Shopify customer data with details such as names, email addresses, and marketing consent status collected via Google One Tap.

(See the Step-by-Step App Embed Guide article for details.)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Check Monthly Email Collection Limit:</p> <ul> <li>Each NudgeAI pricing plan (Starter, AI-Growth) has a maximum limit on the number of \"verified emails\" that can be collected per month (the AI-Scale plan is unlimited). (See the NudgeAI Subscription Plans &amp; Pricing article for details.)</li> <li>If you have already reached this collection limit for your current plan, the AI Pop-up feature will no longer function for the remainder of that month.</li> <li>Check the \"High-value Emails\" and \"Total High-value Emails\" metrics on your NudgeAI dashboard and compare them to your current plan\\'s monthly collection limit.</li> <li>If the limit is exceeded, you can wait for the next monthly collection cycle to begin or consider upgrading to a higher plan.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Check Subscription Plan Status:</p> <ul> <li>In the NudgeAI app admin page, under the \\'Billing\\' or \\'Plan\\' menu, please check if your current subscription plan is active, if the free trial period has expired, or if there have been any payment issues. Problems with your subscription status can lead to a temporary suspension of services. (See the NudgeAI Subscription Plans &amp; Pricing and Managing Your Billing &amp; Invoices articles for details.)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Reconfirm Pop-up Display Rules and Conditions:</p> <ul> <li>AI Plus Pop-up: This pop-up only works on mobile devices. If you are testing on a PC, it\\'s normal for it not to appear. It also appears immediately upon landing on specific pages (Main page, Cart page, Thank You page). If you close the pop-up on a page, it will not reappear on that page for a set period (24 hours for Main/Cart, 7 days for Thank You page). (See the AI Plus Pop-up: Display Conditions &amp; Rules article for details.)</li> <li>AI Lite Pop-up: This pop-up works on both PC and mobile, but it generally appears at the bottom of the screen (or similar) when you scroll down about 50% of the page content. It may not appear immediately upon visiting a page. (See the AI Lite Pop-up: Detailed Display &amp; Closing/Re-display Rules article for details.)</li> <li>Common Non-Display Condition: If a customer has already successfully provided all necessary information (name, email, marketing consent, etc.) through any NudgeAI feature and completed their subscription (or login), the pop-up will no longer be displayed redundantly to that customer.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Browser Cache and Cookie Issues (Important for Testing):</p> <ul> <li>When testing pop-up visibility, records of previously viewing or closing the pop-up might be stored in your browser\\'s cache or cookies, preventing it from appearing.</li> <li>The most accurate way to test is to use your browser\\'s \\'Incognito Mode\\' (or Private Window) or to clear your browser cache and cookies before accessing the store. (Also, see the Verifying Your NudgeAI Setup article.)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Check Shopify Theme Change or Code Modification History:</p> <ul> <li>If you recently changed your Shopify store\\'s theme or directly modified the theme code, it\\'s possible that the NudgeAI app embed settings were disabled or a conflict with other code occurred. Please re-check the app embed activation status from step 1. (Also, see the Theme Compatibility &amp; App Embed article.)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Possibility of Conflict with Other Apps (Rare Cases):</p> <ul> <li>Very rarely, certain features of other apps installed on your store might interfere with the normal operation of the NudgeAI pop-up. If you\\'ve recently installed a new app, you could try temporarily disabling it to see if the NudgeAI pop-up appears.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>If the issue persists after checking all the above steps:</p> <p>Please do not hesitate to contact our NudgeAI Customer Support team. When you contact us, please provide specific details such as which type of pop-up (AI Plus or AI Lite) is not appearing, on which page/environment (PC/mobile, specific page URL), and which of the above self-check steps you have already tried. This information will help us resolve your issue more quickly and accurately. (See the Contacting NudgeAI Customer Support article for details.)</p> <p>We are committed to helping you ensure NudgeAI works smoothly on your store to achieve the best results! </p>"},{"location":"support-troubleshooting/","title":"Support Troubleshooting","text":""},{"location":"support-troubleshooting/common-issues/","title":"Common Issues &amp; Tips","text":"<p>This page is under construction.</p>"},{"location":"support-troubleshooting/contact/","title":"Contact Us","text":"<p>If you have any questions or encounter technical issues while using Nudge AI, please contact us via email:</p> <ul> <li>Email Support: Send your inquiries to <code>support@nudgeaiapp.com</code>.
